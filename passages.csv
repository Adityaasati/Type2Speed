CHSL,"Sir, the Press Council Second Amendment Bill was introduced by me in the last session, as I submitted
in my statement which I laid on the Table of the House. I request the House to consider the Second
Amendment because an Ordinance had to be issued since the life of the Council was expiring. Since the
life of the present council was expiring, we had to issue the Ordinance. At this stage, I do not think have
much to say because it is a very simple Bill. It is only trying to extend the life of the Press Council till the
end of the year. If we are able to finalize the formation of the Press Council earlier, then, of course, the
present term would expire earlier. You will recall, I had said in the course of the last debate that a
Committee of Members of Parliament has been working for the drafting of the second Bill, which is
likely to come up before the end of this session. The Committee has been sitting and they have been
able to come to their conclusions more or less. It is now in the drafting stage and I hope it will be possible
for me to bring the Bill before the House soon, 1 would not like to go into the merits and demerits of
the new Bill at this stage. Would only say that it is a very simple Bill extending the life of the present
Council. I hope the House will approve of this at an early date so that I can go to the other House before
the Budget debate is taken up. No doubt about it; it is a very simple Bill dealing with merely the term
of the Press Council and giving life to the Press Council which would have otherwise expired. Do not
object to the contents of the Bill. It has been my general objection that Article 123 of the Constitution,
which empowers the President to promulgate Ordinances during the recess of Parliament, is a very
special power. Therefore, Sir, it is an extraordinary power which has to be exercised with very great
caution and care and only in an emergent situation. The First Amendment provides that Congress make
no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise.

CHSL,"In the last few years, thanks to jobs becoming global, the importance of English has increased manifold.
It has over the years become an important medium of communication, both at the international and
intra-national levels. The importance of spoken English is even more, because here are many cases.
Where one knows his subject well, but fails to communicate it properly. The practice of spoken English,
therefore, is quite essential. Learning English in a country where it is not a native language, opens a
number of opportunities for the Individual. An individual can make strides in the management ladder
if he or she can speak English fluently. If your English is poor even though with brilliant business ideas,
you may still find yourself languishing at the bottom of the management ladder. Your productivity will
drop over a period of time since you will find difficulty in expressing your brilliant ideas. Those who can
speak good English will probably usurp your ideas and get the credit for all the hard work you did. Group
discussion is one of the ways to test someone's communicative skills generally before the final interview
for a job. An English language trainer trains the candidates for group discussions. While training the
candidates, the trainer aims at grooming the whole personality etc. He usually organizes number of
mock interviews to make the candidates confident and to assess them as where they are lacking in
order to fill the gap. Fear of speaking in front of groups is one of the greatest fears people have. Here,
the role of a trainer is very crucial who trains the candidates in practices confidence, and how to
concentrate on his or her message. The trainer begins with a strategy that includes understanding your
purpose and role. Then he makes the candidate team how to structure his material into a meaningful
message. English is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family, with its earliest
forms spoken by the inhabitants of early medieval England. ",None,10
CHSL,"The Habit of Reading: Studying is the main source of knowledge. Books are indeed never failing friends
of man. For a mature mind, reading is the greatest source of pleasure and solace to distressed minds.
The study of good books ennobles us and broadens our outlook. Therefore, the habit of reading should
be cultivated. A student should never confine himself to his schoolbooks only. He should not miss the
pleasure locked in the classics, poetry, drama, history, philosophy etc. We can derive benefit from
other’s experiences with the help of books. The various sufferings, endurance and joy described in
books enable us to have a closer look at human life. They also inspire us to face the hardships of life
courageously. Nowadays there are innumerable books and time is scarce. So we should read only the
best and the greatest among them. With the help of books we shall be able to make our thinking mature
and our life more meaningful and worthwhile. A Visit to an Exhibition: Recently, an exhibition ‘Building
A New India’ was held in the capital. It was organized by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,
Government of India. The exhibition was set up in the Triveni Kala Sangam. The chief exhibits were
photographs, novels, some sculptures by Indian modern artists presenting Indian cultural inheritance.
First of all, I visited the general section of the exhibition where different charts and photographs
depicting India’s development in various fields were set. Most impressive photographs among these
were those showing India’s nuclear development. The second section dealt with India’s magnificent
historical background. I was fascinated by the pictures of Mohanjodaro excavation. Then I saw the most
beautiful and colorful section of the exhibition i.e. the cultural section. It consisted of paintings,
sculptures, photographs etc. The Rajasthani and Gujarati paintings were very colourful and attractive.
This exhibition, inaugurated by the Prime Minister, lasted for a week.",None,10
CHSL,"My Favorite Teacher: A teacher is called builder of the nation. The profession of teaching needs men
and women with qualities of head and heart. There are many teachers in our school and a large number
of teachers among them are highly qualified. I have great respect for all of them. Yet I have a special
liking for Miss Y. Miss Y is a woman of great principles. She is jewel among all the teachers. Almost all
the students respect her. She teaches us English. She is quite at home in this subject. She takes keen
interest in teaching students. Simple living and high thinking is her motto. She is a woman of sweet
temper and is always ready to help in difficulties. She treats us like her own brothers and sisters. She is
an ideal teacher. It is these qualities of head and heart that have endeared Miss Y to the students and
teachers alike. She is an ideal teacher in real sense of the word. She is the real model to emulate. May
she live as long as there is sweet fragrance in the flowers? When My Teacher Scolded Me: Scolding is
something common in student life. Being a naughty boy, I am always scolded by my parents. But one
day I was severely scolded by my English teacher. She infect teaches well. But that day, I could not resist
the temptation that an adventure of Nancy Drew offered. While she was teaching, I was completely
engrossed in reading that book. Nancy Drew was caught in the trap laid by some smugglers and it was
then when I felt a light tap on my bent head. The teacher had caught me red handed. She scolded me
then and there and insulted me in front of the whole class. I was embarrassed. My cheeks burned being
guilty conscious. When the class was over, I went to the teacher to apologize. When she saw that I had
realized my mistake, she cooled down and then told me in a very kind manner how disheartening it was
when she found any student not paying attention. I was genuinely sorry and promised to myself never
to commit such a mistake again. ",None,10
CHSL,"The Saddest Day of My Life: Days are not of equal value in one’s life. Some bring happiness while others
bring sadness. Sadness and happiness both are equally important to man’s life, since they are the two
sides of a coin. As we cannot forget the happiest day, we are unable to forget the saddest day of our
life too. The saddest day of my life was the Diwali Day. Diwali is considered to be a happy festival and
till last Diwali, it was my favorite festival. On last Diwali, my sister, my brother and I were busy lighting
the fireworks. I was holding a ‘fuljhari’ in my hand and unfortunately my younger brother, who was
standing just beside me, had a cracker in his hand. This cracker caught fire and a very loud explosion
was heard which shook my sister and me. After that, we all could think of nothing else than blood
stained cotton, bandage, dettol etc. My cousin took my brother to the doctor where he got 14 stitches
in his forefinger and thumb. But at home, everybody kept cursing and blaming me for the mishap. That
night, I could not sleep and I cried a lot. For next few days, I bore the burden of this blame for being
responsible for this unfortunate incident. I felt deeply guilty conscious which I was able to overcome
after a long time. Life Is Action, Not Contemplation: Life offers many opportunities to us to succeed and
see it closely. But action is required for it. Goethe, a German philosopher rightly remarked that ‘Life is
action, not contemplation’. Even Charles Darvin proved that this life is a continuous struggle for the
‘survival of the fittest’. One who is not suitable perishes - this is nature’s law. Action is necessary to
adjust ourselves in any possible circumstances. Dreams are the necessary propellers but life itself is not
merely a dream or reverie. Sitting on a chair, brooding, man would never have been able to reach the
moon. But man thought, imagined and strove. Consequently we reached the hitherto unknown heights.
Thus a life of thought and reflection will be futile if man does not try to make it come true in real life.",None,10
CHSL,"Banwarilal is a simple soul who believes whatever he is told. The village boys are aware of this and
exploit his simplicity for a few laughs. One day, Banwarilal is on his way to the market with his son to
sell their donkey. He comes across some village boys out to have fun. Seeing the father and son duo
walking with the donkey, they first suggest that let the son ride on the donkey and save the effort. The
son is put on the donkey’s back. The boys then ridicule the boy for riding while the father walks. The
father and son switch places. The father rides while the son walks. The boys then taunt the father for
making the poor son walk and advise the duo to ride the donkey together. Thinking it a good idea they
comply. The poor donkey collapses from exhaustion. The boys then express their disgust at the duo for
ill-treating the donkey and advice that they take the donkey to an animal doctor. The duo again follows
the advice. On the way, they come across barking stray dogs. In the confusion that ensues, the donkey
falls into the flowing river. The donkey is lost forever. Banwarilal loses the donkey because he follows
what he is suggested without thinking for himself. Moral: He who listens to everybody will only become
a laughing stock. One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water. For a long time,
he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all hope. Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the
tree. He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside. Yes, he could see some water inside
the jug! The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the neck of the jug was too
narrow. Then he tried to push the jug to tilt for the water to flow out, but the jug was too heavy. The
crow thought hard for a while. Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles. He suddenly had a good
idea. He started picking up the pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug. As more and more
pebbles filled the jug, the water level kept rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. His
plan had worked! Moral: Think and work hard, you may find solution to any problem.

CHSL,"French Revolution: At the beginning of the eighteenth century, France was a monarchy ruled by an
autocratic king. The French society was divided into three Estates, or classes. The First Estate consisted
of the clergy. The Second Estate consisted of the nobility. The Third Estate consisted of the peasants
and the bourgeoisie, which included professionals and the wealthy merchants. The First and Second
Estates enjoyed many privileges, and paid almost no taxes. Wealth was concentrated in their hands.
The Third Estate had no privileges. This Estate bore the burden of taxation. The peasants had to perform
unpaid compulsory services. Tax default was punished with imprisonment in the state prison called the
Bastille, which became a symbol of oppression. Inspired by the democratic ideas of French philosophers
like Rousseau, Voltaire and Montesquieu, the bourgeoisie demanded political rights and government
by the consent of the people. Estates-General France had an assembly called the Estates-General, meant
to represent all the three Estates. The Estates-General, however, was never summoned between 1614
and 1789. Benazir Bhutto: Benazir was assassinated on December 27, 2007 in Rawalpindi by the Islamic
terrorists, when she was addressing one of the election meetings due to be held soon afterwards. Her
death postponed the elections; the Pakistan People’s Party triumphed at the polls thereby shattering
the dream of Nawaz Sharief of the Muslim League to occupy power. Zardari, in his earlier avatar as
Consort of Benazir, earned nickname of Mr. 10%. Lo & behold, Mr. 10% now becomes head of the State.
Zardari has visited a number of countries in his quest to seek foreign financial assistance and military
assistance to defeat the Taliban. The monster created by Pakistan refuses to vanish and is now
determined to destabilize the country and bring down the entire superstructure. The Swat Valley in
early 2009 was occupied by the Islamic militants before they were ousted by a determined army action. ",None,10
CHSL,"Climate Change: The climate is the commonly considered to be the weather averaged over a long period
of time, typically 30 years. Somewhat more precisely, the concept of “climate” also includes the
statistics of the weather—such as the degree of day-to-day or year-to-year variation expected. The
Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) glossary definition is: Climate in a narrow sense is
usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of
the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands
or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature,
precipitation, and wind. The factors that determine the climate at a location are the rainfall, sunshine,
wind, humidity and temperature. Climate change refers to long term changes in climate including
overage temperature and precipitation. Earth’s climate is changing and this is causing great concern.
The changes place in the atmosphere have become one of the serious threats that world faces today.
Human activities have the potential to disturb the balance of natural systems and cause warming of the
plant to an unprecedented extent. Some of these countries are increasing the greenhouse gases
emission to an extent that nature system is now not able to assimilate these gases. As a result, climate
change has started endangering biodiversity, food and fresh water supply, impacting human health
worldwide, especially in developing countries like India due to low adaptive capacity. Indias climate can
be classified as a hot tropical country, except the northern states of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu &
Kashmir in the north and Sikkim in the northeastern hills, which have a cooler, more continental
influenced climate. In most of India summer is very hot. In India, summer, winter, and the rainy
season are considered to be the main seasons. We also divide the year into six seasons, namely, vasant,
grishma, varsha, sharad, hemant and shishir.

CHSL,"Value of Science: The present era is the era of science. Science has undoubtedly done a great service to
mankind. Man, a rational being, has been curious to explore mysteries of nature and this led to many
discoveries being made in various part of the world. But he is never satisfied with the acquired
knowledge and is always keen to unravelle mysteries of the universe. He has conquered the land and
air. His incredible lust for knowledge has revolutionised human life and raised the standard of life. He
was able to invent innumerable ways of making his life comfortable and happy. Every sphere of life has
been revolutionized by science. There have been innumerable inventions. One of the greatest
inventions is the invention of medicines. There has been a series of tests carried out using animals as
subjects and various medicines have been tried out on these animals to check their efficacy. Many fatal
diseases can now be cured because we have the drug to fight those diseases. It has reduced the rate of
infant mortality and increased the life span. Before these inventions millions of people died for lack of
medical care. Science has given us many machines that have made our lives very comfortable. Buses,
cars, sewing machines, mixies, grinders, etc. are all machines that are used every day by us and the
discovery of electricity has made it possible for us to change night into day and summer into a
comfortable cool season. It is now easy to cultivate fields as we have tractors. New forms of irrigation
are now being employed. It is easier to protect the crops because of the use of various chemicals and
pesticides. Even mosquitoes can be driven away because of the discoveries made in science. It has
enabled man to entertain himself in many ways. TV, radio, video and the cinema are all popular means
of entertainment. Besides entertainment they educate the masses. Today the computer has made life
even easier for us. The press, the means of communication, etc. have all improved because of science
and its gifts to us. ",None,10
