"""An Indo-Bangladesh Joint Rivers Commission (JRC) headed by Water Resources Ministers of both the countries is functioning since 1972 with a view to maintaining liaison in order to ensure the most effective joint effort in maximizing the benefits from common river systems. A Treaty was signed by the Prime Ministers of India and Bangladesh on 12 December 1996 for the sharing of Ganga/Ganges waters. The Treaty shall remain in force for a period of thirty years to be renewable by mutual consent. A Joint Committee has been set up for implementing joint inspections and 968 India 2011 monitoring of the sharing arrangements at Farakka in India and at Hardinge Bridge in Bangladesh for the dry season (January to May) every year. India is providing the flood data of Farakka for Ganga (from 15 June 15 October) and the flood data of Pandu, Goal Para and Dhubri for Brahmaputra and of Silchar for Barak during monsoon period (from 15 May to 15 October) to Bangladesh for use of their flood forecasting and warning arrangements, besides the data of rivers Teesta, Manu, Gumti, Jaladhaka and Torsa etc.
The transmission of flood forecasting information from India during the monsoon, which is being supplied free of cost, has enabled the civil and military authorities in Bangladesh to shift the population affected by flood to safer places. In the year 2002, the Government of India had entered into an MoU with China for provisionof hydrological information on Yaluzangbu/Brahmaputra river in flood season by China to India. In accordance with the provisions contained in the MoU, the Chinese side is providing hydrological information (Water level, discharge and rainfall) in respect of three stations, located on river Yaluzangbu/Brahmaputra from 1 June to 15 October every year.""",""" Candidates must type words, figures, numbers, and years exactly as given in the Question Paper in both English and Hindi.
